# Project State: Kijko Backend

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** Every mock endpoint becomes a real endpoint
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation & Auth

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Foundation & Auth**
- Status: In progress (Wave 3 of 4 complete)
- Plans: 4 plans in 4 waves (SEQUENTIAL)
  - 01-01: ✅ FastAPI scaffold, config, DI, health endpoint
  - 01-02: ✅ Pydantic models (1,130 lines, 9 files). SQL deploy deferred
  - 01-03: ✅ RLS policies (31 policies, 5 SECURITY DEFINER funcs, 13 tests)
  - 01-04: 🔄 Keycloak auth middleware, auth endpoints, JWT validation
- Blockers: Supabase credentials unavailable (NotebookLM auth expired)

## Progress

| Phase | Status | Plans | Progress |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| 1     | ◐      | 4/4   | 75%      |
| 2     | ○      | 0/6   | 0%       |
| 3     | ○      | 0/3   | 0%       |
| 4     | ○      | 0/3   | 0%       |
| 5     | ○      | 0/4   | 0%       |

## Session Log

### 2026-02-10 — Overnight Sprint Init
- Oracle initialized Swarm-GSD project
- PROJECT.md created from implementation plan + dependency analysis
- Research synthesized from existing documentation (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls)
- 101 requirements defined across 12 categories
- 5-phase roadmap created with Linear ticket mappings
- NotebookLM auth expired — hivemind deferred
- All P0 fixes already in-flight (KIJ-402 XSS fix, KIJ-408 devDeps)

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Phase | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Backend in server/ subdirectory of Kijko-MVP | Init | One repo for frontend+backend integration |
| Skip research agents, synthesize directly | Init | Implementation plan already constitutes research |
| YOLO mode with comprehensive depth | Init | Overnight sprint, maximize throughput |
| Parallel execution enabled | Init | Independent domain routers can be built simultaneously |
